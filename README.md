# Project-VPS

### About this project
The purpose for this personal project was educational in nature and done as a means to gain experience in setting up and configuring a Virtual Private Server (VPS) for my own personal use as opposed to relying upon an established VPN service where data privacy may still be a concern. This guide will describe the steps necessary to create your own variation of a VPS that is suited to your own individual needs.
